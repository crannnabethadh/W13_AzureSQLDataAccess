# CLICKY CRATES SPDVI 2020
## Data Access Library and Winforms UI to test

First, read and follow the doc:
[Creating and accessing an Azure Database](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H5y7uBCC2-kLdOxEoTMrE_L6uB3zD7Y2evdbfhRexks/edit?usp=sharing)
Give feedback in anything which isn't clear enough or different from what expected.

Then clone repo to you machine and follow roadmap.

## .gitignore
The .gitignore file has been modified to not include 'connectionStrings.config'.

## Connection strings
Sensible data to access the DB server is stored in connectionStrings.config. That file has been explicitly removed. I'll provide the file that needs to be added to the project personally.
Then you'll have to add this file to your project and in file properties, Copy to output directory, select Copy always.
